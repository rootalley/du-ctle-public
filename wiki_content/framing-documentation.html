  <h2>Inclusive Teaching and Learning – Who Our Students Are</h2>
  <p>Inclusive teaching is a student-centered approach to teaching that validates students’ cultural perspectives, learning styles, and interests by using dynamic practices to engage and motivate. Inclusive teaching incorporates multicultural content, uses varied assessments to measure student learning, and allows students to explore their interests as they meet course objectives.</p>
  <h2>Interactive Teaching and Learning – How Our Students Learn</h2>
  <p>Teaching for interactive learning is a set of approaches—including team-based learning, strategic uses of technology, community-based learning, collaborative research projects, internships, study away, learning communities, capstone experiences, and other high-impact practices—that encourage students to be dynamically engaged with what they study, to experience teaching and learning as a two-way process, and to see themselves as agents of their own learning.</p>
  <h2>Integrative Teaching and Learning – Why We Teach and Learn</h2>
  <p>Integrative teaching and learning are the practices of making meaningful wholes—synthesizing knowledge across academic boundaries; connecting personal, academic, and community experiences; and evaluating and reflecting on one’s own learning—with the goal of developing increasingly complex frameworks for future learning and action in multiple communities.</p>
  <p>Each of these approaches has a distinctive emphasis, but they complement, support, and strengthen one another. Each approach is most effective when used in conjunction with the others.</p>
