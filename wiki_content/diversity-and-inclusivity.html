  <p>Diversity and inclusiveness is a key aspect to <em>Caritas et Veritas</em>. The importance of creating an inclusive and welcoming learning environment is not only established by abundant learning research but also by Dominican's history and mission. In founding St. Clara's Academy in 1882, Father Samuel Mazzuchelli issued this directive: <q>Make school as much like home as possible.</q> In order to create classroom climates that promote student learning and persistence, we need to recognize that what may feel like a familiar, <q>homelike</q> climate to many of us as individual faculty members may be <q>chilly</q> and estranging to individual students. The work of designing and sustaining inclusive and effective classroom environments is no less complex (and, thus, requires no less effort, assessment, revision and intentionality) than any other dimension of teaching and learning.
