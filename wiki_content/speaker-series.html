        <p class="event-title">Teaching Distracted Minds: Old Challenges, New Contexts</p>
        <p class="event-presenters"> James M. Lang</p>

        <p class="event-description">Faculty concerns about distracted students have intensified as we have all shifted online, but our real focus should be on how we help students achieve attention. This session draws upon scholarship from history,
          neuroscience, and education in order to argue that distractions are endemic to the human condition and can’t be walled out of the physical classroom or online course. Instead, we should focus on creating educational experiences that cultivate
          and sustain attention. Participants will learn about a variety of potential pathways to developing such experiences for their students. </p>
        <p class="event-description">James M. Lang is a Professor of English and the Director of the D’Amour Center for Teaching Excellence at Assumption College in Worcester, MA. He is the author of five books, the most recent of which are Distracted:
          Why Students Can’t Focus and What You Can Do About It (Basic Books, 2020), Small Teaching: Everyday Lessons from the Science of Learning (Jossey-Bass, 2016), and Cheating Lessons: Learning from Academic Dishonesty (Harvard University Press,
          2013).Lang writes a monthly column on teaching and learning for The Chronicle of Higher Education; his work has been appearing in the Chronicle since 1999. </p>
        <p class="event-description">His book reviews and public scholarship on higher education have appeared in a wide variety of newspapers and magazines, including The Conversation, Time, the Boston Globe, and Chicago Tribune. He edits a series of
          books on teaching and learning in higher education for West Virginia University Press; he co-edited the second book in the series, Teaching the Literature Survey Course: New Strategies for College Faculty (2018). </p>
        <p class="event-description">He has conducted workshops on teaching for faculty at more than a hundred colleges or universities in the US and abroad, and consulted for the United Nations on the development of teaching materials in ethics and
          integrity for college faculty. In September of 2016 he received a Fulbright Specialist grant to work with three universities in Colombia on the creation of a MOOC on teaching and learning in STEM education. He has a BA in English and Philosophy
          from the University of Notre Dame, an MA in English from St. Louis University, and a Ph.D. in English from Northwestern University</p>

        <p class="event-title">How (and How Not) to Evaluate Teaching</p>
        <p class="event-presenters">Richard M. Felder</p>
        <p class="event-description">The usual way to evaluate how well a course was taught is to survey the students at the end of the course and compile and average the ratings. If the rating form was carefully designed and validated, this procedure
          provides unique and important information, but by itself it is inadequate to provide a good comprehensive evaluation of teaching quality. Students are not in a position to judge certain aspects of instruction, such as whether the course content
          and learning objectives were appropriate and up-to-date, the instruction followed well-established pedagogical principles, and the instructor had an adequate mastery of the subject. Only peers can do that.</p>
        <p class="event-description">Recognizing this situation, a growing number of institutions have begun to include peer review of teaching in faculty performance evaluations, but here too there are problems. In most peer reviews a faculty member
          observes a single lecture, notes whatever catches his or her attention, draws conclusions that may reflect questionable preconceptions of what constitutes good teaching, and files a report. This procedure does not provide a reliable assessment
          of teaching quality: an observation conducted by a different observer or by the same observer on another day could lead to completely different conclusions. </p>
        <p class="event-description">There are better ways to evaluate teaching. The goals of this seminar are to suggest methods that have been proved effective and to equip participants to design an evaluation process that meets the needs of their
          department. The seminar addresses the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How can I get meaningful student evaluations of teaching?</li>
          <li>How can I get meaningful peer ratings of teaching? </li>
          <li>How can I evaluate teaching performance comprehensively and effectively?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="event-title">Effective Thinking: Strategies to Help Students Think, Learn and Perform Well</p>
        <p class="event-presenters">Leonard Geddes</p>
        <img alt="LearnWell Project" src="https://www.thelearnwellprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/LWlogo.jpg">
        <p class="event-description">Why do students struggle to do sound academic work? Research suggest students’ struggles may stem from their lack of metacognitive skill. When students lack the proper metacognitive infrastructure needed in college,
          they produce outputs but not outcomes. This lack of performance frustrates faculty and stymies students. This workshop shows educators how to strategically use the ThinkWell-LearnWell Diagram, Compendium of Thinking Skills and the Outcome
          Decoder Chart to help students think, learn and perform well.</p>
        <p class="event-description">Leonard Geddes is the founder of <a href="https://thelearnwellprojects.com/">The LearnWell Projects</a>, an academic success organization that is devoted to making learning more visible, manageable, and effective. Mr.
          Geddes' work spans several years of conducting ethnographic observations on how students do academic work. His work leverages metacognition research to optimize student learning, enhance faculty instruction, and improve institutional outcomes.
        </p>
        <p class="event-description">Mr. Geddes provides metacognitive-based workshops and trainings for colleges and universities throughout North America. He is a frequent invited speaker for several national student success, pedagogy, and research
          conferences.</p>
        <p class="event-description">Educators, researchers, students, parents, and policymakers frequently access The LearnWell Projects' website to access research-based, practical solutions to academic challenges. Mr. Geddes forthcoming book How to
          Successfully Transition Undergraduate Students into College will be published with Stylus Publishing in 2021.</p>
