    <dd>This study investigated exam achievement and affective characteristics of students in general chemistry in a fully-randomized experimental design, contrasting Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) participation with a control group balanced for time-on-task and study activity. This study population included two independent first-semester courses with enrollments of about 600. Achievement was measured by scores on exams written by an instructor blind to student participation. Established instruments were used to assess changes in attitude to chemistry and self-concept as a chemistry learner</dd>

    <dd>The article discusses the application of Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) program at the University of Texas in Dallas. It mentions that the program was offered at the university in the fall 2008 semester and limited to students taking the course, General Chemistry I which is required for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) major degrees and considered as a possible obstacle for them. It notes that students enrolled in the program's supported courses have the opportunity to register for a free ninety-minute small-group session facilitated by PLTL leaders who are scholars with higher grade level. It also points out its reduction of distance between learners and instructors.</dd>

    <dd>A Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) program was implemented in a first-year, undergraduate Anatomy and Physiology course sequence to examine the student perceptions of the program and determine the effects of PLTL on student performance. PLTL was integrated into four sections of Anatomy and Physiology I and II in the fall 2010 and spring 2011 semesters. Students (N = 127, 70% completing the courses) completed a perceptual survey of the PLTL program, which was inserted into the Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) online instrument</dd>

    <dd>Robust evidence shows that Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) improves the academic success of first-year college students in introductory Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. Less clear is the extent to which this positive PLTL effect varies across different subgroups of the population. The current study aims to deepen our understanding of the overall PLTL effect by extensively evaluating an optional PLTL program associated with General Chemistry I at a private, research university. Using five years of exam data, this study disaggregates the PLTL effect by demographics (sex and race), academic preparation (math skills, chemistry content knowledge, and experience with college-preparatory coursework), and participation in another curricular innovation (a growth-mindset intervention)</dd>

    <dd>In late 2011, we created a Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) program focused on improving student performance in high-risk STEM courses. Our PALs are modeled after the Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) program, which has been shown to provide long- and short-term benefits to both students (Chan &amp; Bauer, 2015; Gosser, Kampeier, &amp; Pratibha, 2010; Lewis, 2011) and peer leaders (Gafney &amp; Pratibha, 2007). The PLTL model often describes key qualities for student leaders, including excellence with content, independence, and an outgoing personality (Tien, Roth, &amp; Kampmeier, 2004).</dd>

    <dd>This five-year study of the peer-led team learning (PLTL) paradigm examined its implementation in a Calculus I course at an all-male HBCU institution. For this study we set up a strong control group and measured the effect of PLTL in the teaching and learning of Calculus I through two points of measure: retention and success rates and learning gains. Our analysis reveals those aspects that can make the implementation of PLTL in calculus and perhaps in mathematics in general challenging and also shows hopeful aspects that promote better learning of the subject.</dd>

    <dd>Collaborative learning is being used extensively by educators at all levels. Peer-led team learning in a version of collaborative learning that has shown consistent success in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines. Using a multi-phase research study we describe the development of an observation instrument that can be used to assess peer-led group learning. This paper illustrates the development of a classification system for peer-led learning groups and an instrument based on this classification system. The instrument evaluates small learning groups on two important aspects of group learning: problem solving approach and group interaction style.</dd>

    <dd>Peer-led Team Learning (PLTL) is an instructional method reported to increase student learning in STEM courses. As mathematics is a significant hurdle for many freshmen engineering students, a PLTL program was implemented for students to attempt to improve their course performance. Here, an analysis of PLTL for freshmen engineering students in mathematics courses over three years is presented. The particular issue of concern is if a student's performance in their mathematics courses improves significantly with frequent participation in PLTL groups.</dd>
