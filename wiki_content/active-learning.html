  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>The concepts of Active Learning works to expand our instruction in ways that is welcoming to every student's learning aptitude. This page offers multiple resources on the subject to so that we may better apply them in our lessons and teaching styles.</p>
  <h2>What is Active Learning?</h2>
  <p>"Students must do more than just listen: They must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems. Most important, to be actively involved, students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Within this context, it is proposed that strategies promoting active learning be defined as instructional activities involving students in doing things and thinking about what they are doing.‚ÄùBonwell, C.; Eison, J. (1991). Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom.&nbsp; AEHE-ERIC Higher Education Report No. 1. Washington, D.C.: Jossey-Bass</p>
  <p>Herrington and Oliver (2000)&nbsp;have identified&nbsp;the following characteristics of authentic learning:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>authentic contexts</dt>
    <dd>that reflect the way the knowledge will be used&nbsp; in real-life</dd>
    <dt>authentic activities</dt>
    <dd>that are complex, ill-defined problems and investigations</dd>
    <dt>access to expert performances</dt>
    <dd>enabling modeling of processes</dd>
    <dt>multiple roles and perspectives</dt>
    <dd>providing alternative solution pathway</dd>
    <dt>collaboration</dt>
    <dd>allowing for the social construction of knowledge</dd>
    <dt>opportunities for reflection</dt>
    <dd>involving metacognition</dd>
    <dt>opportunities for articulation&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>to enable tacit knowledge to be made explicit</dd>
    <dt>coaching and scaffolding</dt>
    <dd>by the teacher at critical times</dd>
    <dt>authentic assessment</dt>
    <dd>that reflect the way knowledge is assessed in real life.</dd>
