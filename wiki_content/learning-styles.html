  <p><img src="$IMS-CC-FILEBASE$/images/learning_styles.jpeg" alt="Graphic illustration depicting learning styles. What's your learning style? Verbal learning style:
Words are your strongpoint! You prefer to use words both in speech and in writing! Physical/Kinaesthetic learning style: You use your hands, body and sense of touch to help you learn. You might 'act things out'. Visual learning style: You prefer to use pictures, diagrams, images and spatial understanding to help you learn. Musical/Auditory You prefer using sounds or music or even rhythms to help you learn. Logical/Mathematical learning style: Learning is easier for you if you use logic, reasoning, systems and sequences. Social learning style: You like to learn new things as a part of a group. Explaining your understanding to a group helps you to learn. Solitary learning style: You like to work alone. You use self-study and prefer your own company when learning. Combination learning style: Your learning style is a combination of two or more of these styles." data-api-endpoint="https://dominicanu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1667544/files/182743285" data-api-returntype="File"></p>

  <h2>Learning Styles Preferences</h2>
  <p><img src="$IMS-CC-FILEBASE$/images/dunn_learning_styles.png" alt="Dunn and Dunn's learning styles model shows many different elements that affect learning: Environmental, Emotional, Sociological, Physiological, and Psychological. Environmental—Where and How Learners Study: How do you control your food and drink intake? What seating is most comfortable?  How much sound do you prefer? What conditions, i.e., temperature, light, air flow and clothing, make you more comfortable? Emotional—Motivation and Responsibility: Is the task relevant? Is there enough direction? Sociological—Interaction and Authority: How many people do you prefer to work with? How much control or guidance do you need over your work? Physiological—Learning Modality: Do you prefer movement while studying? What time of day do you study best? Are you a visual, auditory, verbal or kinesthetic learner? Psychological—Strategies for Problem Solving: Do you view the problem globally, big picture, or look at each individual piece separately? Do you jump into a problem head on or plan before working?" data-api-endpoint="https://dominicanu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1667544/files/182743427" data-api-returntype="File"></p>
