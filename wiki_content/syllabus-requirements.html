  <h3>Section D: Course Syllabi</h3>
  <p>In order best to serve the learning needs of students, faculty members are expected to provide students (and appropriate Chairs or Directors, and Deans) with a written syllabus for each course, including those taught wholly or in part through Canvas. Across the University, each syllabus should have the following common components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Course title and number, cross listings, and description;</li>
    <li>Prerequisites or co-requisites and Area Study or Core Requirement met by course;</li>
    <li>Meeting time/days, and location or instructional contact times;</li>
    <li>Contact information for Instructor, including office hours, office telephone, and e-mail address;</li>
    <li>Required and recommended texts and course materials, including title, author and ISBN;</li>
    <li>Course learning goals;</li>
    <li>Course calendar or schedule, indicating deadlines for major assignments(with appropriate disclaimer about flexibility);</li>
    <li>Expectations concerning time on course work outside of class;</li>
    <li>Expectations concerning climate of respect and civility;</li>
    <li>Assessment criteria for student learning,including kinds of assignments,papers, exams, presentations, participation, etc.;</li>
    <li>Grading policy, including attendance and participation;</li>
    <li>Academic integrity definitions and reference to policy;13. Statement referencing University policy for students with special learning needs;</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Syllabi are the property of the University and must be provided for every course every semester in a format (Microsoft Word or PDF) that can be archived electronically. While there is sensitivity to the special dynamics of courses taught wholly or in part through Canvas, syllabi must also be archived for those courses. This not only serves student and advisors, but also helps guide decisions about transferability of courses in and out of Dominican, and meets the expectations of accrediting bodies and government agencies. All syllabi provided electronically must be accessible to comply with the ADA and other disability laws.</p>
  <p>Resources on syllabus design are available through the Borra Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence. Sample syllabi are available through the departmental or school archive.</p>
