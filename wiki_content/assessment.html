  <h2>Classroom Assessment Techniques</h2>
  <img alt="Assessment Techniques" src="https://www.westminster.edu/about/accreditation-assessment/images/pdca_course.gif">
  <h3>Prior Knowledge, Recall, and Understanding</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Focused Listing</dt>
    <dd>Select an important topic that the class is likely to have studied or is about to study in your class (i.e.: information has value). Have the students list related terms or ideas important to understanding that topic. Provides students with a focus for your instruction session, while allowing you to understand what they may or may not know about the topic.</dd>
    <dt>Background Knowledge Probe</dt>
    <dd>Small questionnaire designed to give the instructor a sense of student baseline knowledge and allows the instructor to decide where to begin instruction. Provides information on concepts for which the students are most unclear. This guides teaching to refocus on issues students are having with various issues.</dd>
    <dt>Misconceptions/Preconceptions Check</dt>
    <dd>You identify troublesome concepts within information literacy and create a brief questionnaire to elicit students’ ideas and beliefs in these areas. Allows you to uncover unlikely barriers to learning and gives students a safe space to reveal their own ideas and beliefs.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Synthesis and Creative Thinking</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Concept Maps</dt>
    <dd>Students draw maps or diagrams to demonstrate their mental models between major concepts taught by the instructor and prior knowledge. Low-tech way to get a graphical view of students’ conceptual associations.</dd>
    <dt>One-Sentence Summary</dt>
    <dd>Challenges students to answer: “Who does what to whom, when, where, how and why?” about a topic and then synthesize those answers into one single summary sentence. Enables teachers to find out how much and what students know about a large amount of information on a given topic.</dd>
    <dt>What’s the Principle?</dt>
    <dd>Identify basic principles you want the students to learn in class and create several short examples that may or may not illustrate these principles. Students match examples to the associated principles. Demonstrates student problem solving skills by providing students with a problem and asking them to solve the problem by identifying the principle that best applies to the problem.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Application and Performance</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Memory Matrix</dt>
    <dd>Instructor draws simple matrix with row and column headings representing categories of information covered during the lesson. Students fill in the blank cells with their analysis. Assesses student recall of important information about a specific instruction session and their ability to organize the information into categories laid out by the instructor.</dd>
    <dt>Application Cards</dt>
    <dd>The instructor passes out index cards to the students and has them write down one or two real world applications of what they just learned. The instructor is able to assess what the students learned and the students are able to create connections between new information and prior knowledge.</dd>
    <dt>Problem Recognition Tasks</dt>
    <dd>Choose examples of varying but related problems that students find difficult to distinguish, and have them identify the problem. Assesses how students approach problems and if they can recognize which solutions work best for which problems.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Analysis and Critical Thinking</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Pro/Con Grid</dt>
    <dd>Gives teachers an overview of student’s analysis of the pros versus cons, costs versus benefits, or advantages versus disadvantages of a problem. Allows you to assess divergent and convergent thinking about topics that have varying viewpoints.</dd>
    <dt>Defining Features Matrix</dt>
    <dd>Focus on one or two topics that are similar enough to confuse students and chose features of those concepts that are most critical for the students to recognize. A matrix is drawn up so students must choose which feature belongs to which topic. Allows you to quickly assess students’ skills at distinguishing between two concepts so you can effectively clear up any confusion. Also gives students practice at the transferable skill of categorizing data.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Learner Values, Attitudes, and Self-Awareness</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Classroom Opinion Poll</dt>
    <dd>Think about what you are going to teach and draw up questions that address one or two of the concepts you will introduce to students. Students anonymously provide their opinions about these topics prior to your class with justification. Engage students in a way that allows them to feel safe in expressing their own thoughts, and allows you to adjust your teaching based on their opinions helping you to prepare to deal with a range of opinions.</dd>
    <dt>Process Analysis</dt>
    <dd>Have students keep track of their research processes including what steps they took, how much time each step took and to describe their process in a narrative. Focuses on the process rather than the product, allows the instructor to compare processes across a single group of students, and uncovers productive strategies that may be shared with other students.</dd>
    <dt>Teacher-Designed Feedback Forms</dt>
    <dd>Instructor creates a form for students to fill out at the end of the class session focusing specifically on the instructor and/or content. Feedback forms (tests and quizzes) designed by the teacher to gain a limited and focused response to specific questions about an instruction session or content.</dd>
